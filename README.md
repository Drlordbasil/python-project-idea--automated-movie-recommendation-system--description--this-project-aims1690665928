## Description
The movie recommendation system utilizes popular movie datasets available online, such as the MovieLens dataset or IMDb dataset, to gather information about movies, including titles, genres, ratings, and user reviews. The datasets can be downloaded directly within the program.

The program cleans and preprocesses the movie dataset to ensure data quality. This includes handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and transforming categorical features into numerical representations.

To provide accurate movie recommendations, the system implements collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques using machine learning algorithms. It analyzes user preferences and similarities to identify similar users or movies and offer personalized recommendations based on movie characteristics.

To enhance the recommendation engine, users can rate movies they have watched, providing feedback to improve future recommendations and personalize results further.

To keep the recommendation system up-to-date with the latest movie releases and popularity trends, the program utilizes APIs like OMDB API or TMDb API to fetch real-time data about movies, including details like ratings, reviews, release dates, and trailers.

The system can be deployed as a web application, allowing users to access it from any device without requiring any local files, ensuring accessibility and convenience.

3. Collaborative Filtering: Implements collaborative filtering techniques to provide accurate movie recommendations based on user preferences and similarities.
4. Content-Based Filtering: Offers movie recommendations based on movie characteristics using content-based filtering techniques.
5. User Interaction: Provides a user-friendly interface to gather user preferences and offer personalized recommendations.
6. Automated Rating Collection: Users can rate movies they have watched to improve future recommendations and personalize results.
7. Real-time Movie Data: Utilizes APIs to fetch real-time data about movies, including details like ratings, reviews, release dates, and trailers.
8. Deployment: Can be deployed as a web application for easy access.

## Usage
To use the movie recommendation system, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have installed all the necessary dependencies (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).
2. Download the movie data CSV file.
3. Replace `path_to_movie_data.csv` in the code with the actual path to the movie data CSV file.
4. Run the Python script.
5. Enter the movie title you want to find recommendations for.
6. The program will provide the top recommended movies based on the entered movie title.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
    ```shell
    pip install pandas scikit-learn
    ```
3. Download the movie data CSV file.
4. Replace `path_to_movie_data.csv` in the code with the actual path to the movie data CSV file.
5. Run the Python script.
